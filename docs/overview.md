# CEO Curse (CuRSe): Financial Survival Toolkit

## The CEO's Essential Framework

CEO Curse provides executives with a structured approach to financial survival. Our name represents the three essential tools every CEO needs:

- **C**ut expenses strategically
- **R**aise capital efficiently
- **S**ell something profitably

The harsh reality: 82% of business failures stem from cash flow problems. Yet most executive training focuses on leadership, strategy, and visionâ€”not the practical financial tools needed for survival.
