## Challenges & Learnings

3. **Market timing**: Increasing competition in financial tools for executives

### Key Learnings
1. **Problem validation**: The "Cut expenses" module has the highest immediate demand and should be prioritized
2. **Pricing sensitivity**: Early interviews suggest a sweet spot of $97-197/month for individual executive access
3. **Distribution strategy**: LinkedIn outreach is outperforming other channels 3:1 for early signups
4. **User segmentation**: Clear segmentation emerging between funded startups vs. bootstrapped businesses

## Burn Rate & Runway

- **Current monthly burn**: $4,200
- **Runway remaining**: 8.5 months (with current resources)
- **Fundraising status**: Initial conversations with 3 angel investors
